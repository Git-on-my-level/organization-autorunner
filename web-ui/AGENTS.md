# AGENTS

## Scope
Guide for work inside `web-ui/`.

Read this after the root [AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md). Keep this file focused on durable operator-facing purpose, UI boundaries, and the invariants that protect safe interaction with `oar-core`.

## Module Purpose
`web-ui` is the human-operator control surface for Organization Autorunner.

It gives operators fast, glanceable visibility into the shared workspace maintained by `oar-core` and provides explicit paths for human intervention such as decisions, reviews, snapshot edits, acknowledgments, and message posting. It is a client of `oar-core`, not an agent runtime or orchestration layer.

## UI Responsibilities
- Treat `oar-core` as the single source of truth for all durable state.
- Optimize for operator usability: clear status, triage context, provenance visibility, and at-a-glance understanding of what needs attention.
- Provide the main human workflow surfaces for inbox triage, thread inspection, commitments, boards, artifacts, documents, and review flows.
- Handle forward-compatible data safely: unknown event types, artifact kinds, refs, and fields must remain visible rather than breaking the UI.
- Gate writes safely through actor-aware and workspace-aware flows while preserving core contract semantics.

## High-Value Invariants
- Persistent writes go through `oar-core`; the UI must not invent its own source of truth.
- Unknown or newer data must degrade gracefully and remain inspectable.
- Snapshot edits use patch semantics and must not overwrite fields the UI does not understand.
- Restricted transitions and provenance-sensitive fields must remain clearly evidence-backed versus inferred.
- The UI should favor glanceable inspection and targeted intervention over exhaustive agent-facing control surfaces.

## What Web UI Does Not Own
- Canonical storage or schema authority.
- Agent orchestration or automation workflows.
- Real-world side effects outside the OAR workspace.

## Canonical References
- Product and UX spec: `docs/oar-ui-spec.md`
- HTTP contract: `docs/http-api.md`
- Shared schema: `../contracts/oar-schema.yaml`
- Spec compliance matrix: `docs/spec-compliance.md`
- Runbook: `docs/runbook.md`
- Visual style guidance: `docs/style-guide.md`

## Edit Routing
- Shared API or schema changes start in [../contracts/AGENTS.md](../contracts/AGENTS.md).
- UI behavior changes should be checked against operator clarity first, then contract compatibility.
- Routing, proxy, and mock-mode changes must preserve the single-source-of-truth model and startup compatibility checks.
- Presentation changes should preserve glanceability and safe fallback behavior for unknown data.

## Validation
- `make -C web-ui check`
- `./scripts/test`
- Add or update unit and e2e coverage for affected operator flows.
- When contracts change, run `make contract-gen` and `make contract-check` from repo root.

## Maintenance Guidance
- Keep this file centered on human-operator purpose and durable UI boundaries.
- Put route-by-route details and implementation specifics in specs, runbooks, or code-local docs.
- Update this guide when the operator surface or its boundaries materially change.
