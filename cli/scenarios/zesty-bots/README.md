# Scenario: Zesty Bots Lemonade Co.

A fictional automated lemonade stand run by bots. The workspace is pre-seeded with a realistic operational state spanning incidents, initiatives, and in-progress work orders.

## Workspace State

Seeded data lives in `core/.oar-workspace/`. Run core against this workspace to get the scenario live.

## Prerequisites

```bash
# Terminal 1: start core against the seeded workspace
cd core
go run ./cmd/oar-core \
  --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000 \
  --schema-path ../contracts/oar-schema.yaml \
  --workspace-root .oar-workspace

# Terminal 2: build CLI
cd cli
go build ./cmd/oar
```

## Running the Walkthroughs

```bash
cd cli/scenarios/zesty-bots

bash coordinator.sh    # triage inbox, make a decision
bash worker.sh         # execute a work order, submit receipt
bash orchestrator.sh   # scan stream, detect work orders
bash reviewer.sh       # review a receipt, post outcome
```

Each script registers its own fresh agent so runs are independent and repeatable.

## Harness Manifest

This scenario also has a harness manifest for multi-agent integration runs:

- `harness.scenario.json`
- `harness.nontrivial.scenario.json` (docs lifecycle + optimistic concurrency conflict)

From `cli/`:

```bash
go build -o oar ./cmd/oar
go build -o oar-scenario ./cmd/oar-scenario

./oar-scenario \
  --scenario scenarios/zesty-bots/harness.scenario.json \
  --oar-bin ./oar \
  --mode deterministic

./oar-scenario \
  --scenario scenarios/zesty-bots/harness.nontrivial.scenario.json \
  --oar-bin ./oar \
  --mode deterministic
```

## Resetting Workspace State

The seeded workspace state is read-only artifacts and snapshots. Events written by scenario scripts accumulate but do not break the seeded threads. To fully reset, stop core and restore `core/.oar-workspace/state.sqlite` from git.
