## `onboarding`

Offline quick-start mental model and first command flow.

```text
Onboarding: first steps

Use onboarding to get a working session quickly. For the fuller operating model, read `oar meta doc agent-guide`.

1. Point the CLI at the core API with `--base-url` or `OAR_BASE_URL`.
2. Register or select a reusable agent/profile with `--agent`.
3. Confirm connectivity and identity with `oar doctor` and `oar auth whoami`.
4. Run a cheap read command before any mutation.
5. Use `oar meta skill cursor` if you want a bundled Cursor skill file generated from the shipped guide.

First commands to run

  oar --base-url http://127.0.0.1:8000 --agent <agent> doctor
  oar --base-url http://127.0.0.1:8000 --agent <agent> auth bootstrap status
  oar --base-url http://127.0.0.1:8000 --agent <agent> auth register --username <username> --bootstrap-token <token>
  oar --agent <agent> auth whoami
  oar --agent <agent> threads list
  oar --agent <agent> inbox stream --max-events 1

Next step

  oar meta doc agent-guide
```

## `agent-guide`

Prescriptive agent guide for choosing OAR primitives, operating safely, and automating the CLI well.

```text
Agent guide

Use this guide when you need to operate `oar` well, not just get it running. Favor stable CLI patterns over environment-specific setup.

Operating posture

- Treat `oar` as the contract-aligned interface to an OAR core API.
- Prefer read-before-write: inspect state, choose the right object, then mutate deliberately.
- Prefer `--json` for automation, default output for quick human inspection.
- Prefer profiles and env vars over repeated flags.
- Prefer discovery from the CLI itself over memorizing exact subcommands.


Core model

- `events`: immutable facts, observations, and updates. Use for append-only activity, audit trails, and streams.
- `threads`: durable work objects and coordination state. Use for initiatives, incidents, cases, processes, relationships, and similar work units.
- `inbox`: work intake and notifications. Use to see what needs attention and ack handled items.
- `draft`: staged or reviewable mutations. Use when a write should be inspected before commit.
- `docs`: long-lived narrative knowledge. Use for plans, notes, decisions, summaries, and shared context.
- `boards`: structured coordination views. Use to group and review work across multiple objects.
- `auth` and profiles: identity plus reusable config.
- `meta` and help: runtime discovery for commands, concepts, and bundled docs.

Heuristic:
- Use `events` for facts.
- Use `threads` for ongoing work and ownership.
- Use `docs` for narrative or reference material.
- Use `boards` for portfolio or workflow visibility.
- Use `draft` when you want a checkpoint before applying change.

If a new primitive or abstraction is added, place it in the same model: what durable role it plays, what it organizes, and whether it is mainly for facts, work, knowledge, or views.


Higher-level concepts

- `docs` are the long-lived narrative layer. Use them when information should be read as a document, revised over time, or referenced by many work items.
- `boards` are coordination views. Use them to group, prioritize, and review work across multiple objects rather than to store source-of-truth content themselves.
- `threads` often back execution; `docs` explain; `boards` organize. Keep those roles distinct.


Standard workflow

1. Confirm environment and identity.
2. Discover current state with list/get/context commands.
3. Decide which primitive matches the task.
4. Make the smallest valid mutation.
5. Verify via read commands, timeline, stream, or resulting state.

For interrupt-driven work, a common loop is: `inbox` -> inspect related `thread` or `doc` -> apply change directly or via `draft` -> verify -> ack inbox item.


Configuration

- Set the target core with `--base-url` or `OAR_BASE_URL`.
- Reuse identity/config with `--agent` or `OAR_AGENT`.
- Use env vars in scripts so command bodies stay portable and short.
- If available, run `oar doctor` when config or connectivity is unclear.
- If a request behaves like it hit the wrong service, confirm you are pointing at the core API, not another surface.

Config precedence is typically: flags -> environment -> profile -> defaults.


Discovery first

Do not overfit to examples in this guide. Ask the CLI what exists now:

  oar help
  oar help <group>
  oar help <group> <command>
  oar meta docs
  oar meta doc <topic>

Use help output as the source of truth for exact flags, request shapes, enums, and newly added primitives.


Command habits

- Use list/get/context/workspace commands to orient before editing.
- Use `--full-id` when an ID will be reused in later commands.
- Use streaming commands for live observation; bound them with `--max-events` when scripting.
- Use `draft` or proposal/apply flows when the CLI exposes them and the change benefits from reviewability.
- Prefer narrow filters over broad listings when triaging large state.


Automation

- Use `--json` for machine consumption.
- Parse the response envelope, not formatted text.
- Treat `error.code`, `error.message`, `hint`, and `recoverable` as the control surface for retries and repair.
- Keep scripts idempotent where possible: read state, compare, then write only when needed.


Onboarding and recovery

When starting in a new environment:

1. Set base URL.
2. Check onboarding state with `oar auth bootstrap status` before first registration.
3. Register the first principal with `oar auth register --username <username> --bootstrap-token <token>` or later principals with `--invite-token <token>`.
4. Confirm identity.
5. Run a cheap read command.

When stuck:

- Re-run with `--json` to inspect structured failure details.
- Check help for the exact command path you are using.
- Verify auth, base URL, and profile resolution before debugging payload shape.


Maintenance rule

- Keep this guide focused on durable usage patterns.
- Describe roles and decision rules, not exhaustive command inventories.
- Prefer `oar help` and `oar meta docs` over embedding fragile schemas.
- Mention examples of primitives and abstractions, but avoid implying the list is closed.
```

## `draft`

Local draft staging, listing, commit, and discard workflow.

```text
Draft staging

Use `oar draft` when you want a local checkpoint before sending a write to core.

Choose the right path:

- Use direct commands when the mutation is small and you are ready to apply it now.
- Prefer command-specific proposal flows when they exist, such as `threads propose-patch` or `docs propose-update`, because they add domain-aware diff/review helpers.
- Use `draft` for lower-level commands, generic JSON bodies, or cases where you want to stage the exact request before commit.

Standard workflow

1. Build the exact payload for the target command.
2. Stage it with `draft create`.
3. Inspect staged drafts with `draft list`.
4. Commit when ready, or discard if the request should not be sent.

Usage:
  oar draft create --command <command-id> [--from-file <path>]
  oar draft list
  oar draft commit <draft-id> [--keep]
  oar draft discard <draft-id>

Heuristics

- Keep drafts short-lived; they are a checkpoint, not durable state.
- Prefer one clear intent per draft.
- Use `--from-file` or stdin for non-trivial JSON bodies so requests stay reproducible.
- Re-read current state before committing older drafts if the target may have changed.

Examples:
  cat payload.json | oar draft create --command threads.create
  oar draft list
  oar draft commit draft-20260305T103000-a1b2c3d4e5f6
```

## `provenance`

Deterministic provenance walk reference and examples.

```text
Provenance guide

Use `oar provenance walk` when you need to answer questions like:

- Why does this object exist?
- What evidence or earlier object led to it?
- What thread, artifact, event, or snapshot is this derived from?

Mental model

- Provenance is a graph of typed refs, not just a linear event log.
- Start from the object you trust most, then walk outward a few hops.
- Keep walks narrow at first; increase depth only when the first pass is insufficient.
- Use event-chain expansion when you specifically need event-to-event lineage, not as the default for every investigation.

Usage:
  oar provenance walk --from <typed-ref> [--depth <n>] [--include-event-chain]

Typed ref roots:
  event:<id>
  thread:<id>
  artifact:<id>
  snapshot:<id>

Heuristics

- Start from `event:<id>` when explaining one update or mutation.
- Start from `thread:<id>` when explaining a work item's evidence and history.
- Start from `artifact:<id>` when tracing a file or attachment back to its source.
- Start from `snapshot:<id>` when investigating derived or captured state.
- Prefer shallow depths like 1-3 before broader traversals.

Examples:
  oar --json provenance walk --from event:event_123 --depth 2
  oar --json provenance walk --from snapshot:snapshot_123 --depth 1
  oar provenance walk --from event:event_123 --depth 3 --include-event-chain

```

## `import`

Prescriptive import guide for building low-duplication, discoverable OAR graphs from external material.

```text
Import guide

Use `oar import` to turn external material into a clean OAR graph. The goal is not to dump files into the system. The goal is to create discoverable threads, docs, and artifacts with low duplication, low orphan rates, and clear provenance.

Object model

- `threads` hold ongoing work, collector structures, and discoverable entry points.
- `docs` hold narrative knowledge, summaries, and hub content.
- `artifacts` hold raw or attached evidence.
- Import should create a graph that people and agents can navigate, not just a pile of uploaded files.

Read in this order

1. `oar help import` — doctrine, quality bars, and the recommended loop.
2. `oar help import scan` — inventory and text-cache generation.
3. `oar help import plan` — classification, collector threads, hub docs, and review bundles.
4. If you will execute writes: `oar help threads create`, `oar help artifacts create`, and `oar help docs create`.
5. Optional graph/provenance reference: `oar help provenance`.

Operating stance

- High precision beats high recall.
- Exact duplicates should be skipped before writes.
- Ambiguous or noisy material should be skipped or deferred to review bundles.
- Imported material should usually get a discoverable entry point: a collector thread, a hub doc, or both.
- Codebases should not become one OAR object per source file.
- Binary attachments should be preserved conservatively; if reliable raw upload is not available, keep explicit pending work instead of pretending they were imported cleanly.
- Prefer preview-first planning over eager execution.

Recommended loop

1. `oar import scan --input <dir-or-zip>`
2. `oar import dedupe --inventory ./.oar-import/<source>/inventory.jsonl`
3. `oar import plan --inventory ./.oar-import/<source>/inventory.jsonl`
4. Review `plan-preview.md`, `skipped`, and `review_bundles`.
5. `oar import apply --plan ./.oar-import/<source>/plan.json` for payload previews.
6. `oar import apply --plan ./.oar-import/<source>/plan.json --execute` only after the plan looks clean.

Subcommands

  import scan      Build normalized inventory + text cache from a folder or zip
  import dedupe    Find exact duplicates and probable duplicate review clusters
  import plan      Build a conservative OAR-native import plan
  import apply     Write payload previews and optionally execute creates

Output conventions

- Default workdir is `./.oar-import/<source-name>`.
- `scan` writes `inventory.jsonl` and `scan-summary.json`.
- `dedupe` writes `dedupe.json`.
- `plan` writes `plan.json` and `plan-preview.md`.
- `apply` writes payload previews plus `apply-results.json` and `apply-commands.sh`.
