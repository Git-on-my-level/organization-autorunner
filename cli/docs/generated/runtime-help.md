## `onboarding`

Offline quick-start mental model and first command flow.

```text
Onboarding: first steps

Use onboarding to get a working session quickly. For the fuller operating model, read `oar meta doc agent-guide`.

1. Point the CLI at the core API with `--base-url` or `OAR_BASE_URL`.
2. Register or select a reusable agent/profile with `--agent`.
3. Confirm connectivity and identity with `oar doctor` and `oar auth whoami`.
4. Run a cheap read command before any mutation.
5. Use `oar meta skill cursor` if you want a bundled Cursor skill file generated from the shipped guide.
6. Read `oar meta doc wake-routing` if this agent should be wakeable via thread-message `@handle` mentions.

First commands to run

  oar --base-url http://127.0.0.1:8000 --agent <agent> doctor
  oar --base-url http://127.0.0.1:8000 --agent <agent> auth bootstrap status
  oar --base-url http://127.0.0.1:8000 --agent <agent> auth register --username <username> --bootstrap-token <token>
  oar --agent <agent> auth whoami
  oar --agent <agent> topics list
  oar --agent <agent> inbox stream --max-events 1

Next step

  oar meta doc agent-guide
  oar meta doc wake-routing
```

## `concepts`

Quick guide to the core OAR primitives and when to use each.

```text
OAR concepts guide

Use this command when you need to decide which primitive fits the task before you start issuing writes.

Selection rules:
- Use events for immutable facts.
- Use topics for durable work subjects and primary operator coordination (`topics workspace`).
- Use cards for board-scoped planning and movement.
- Use threads for read-only backing-thread diagnostics and timeline inspection — not as the default coordination surface.
- Use docs for narrative knowledge that should be revised over time.
- Use boards for cross-object workflow views, not source-of-truth content.
- Use inbox for current attention signals from the active CLI identity's perspective.
- Use draft when you want a local review checkpoint before a write.

topics
- Use when: You need the durable work subject itself with ownership, summary, related refs, and provenance — including the primary operator coordination read.
- Not for: Board-scoped task placement or low-level backing-thread-only diagnostics.
- Examples: initiatives, incidents, cases, deliverables
- Read next: oar topics list ; oar topics get ; oar topics workspace

threads
- Use when: You need read-only backing-thread diagnostics: timelines, raw thread records, or thread-scoped projection bundles for troubleshooting.
- Not for: Primary operator triage when a topic exists — use topics workspace instead.
- Examples: backing thread timeline, diagnostic workspace projection, compatibility inspection
- Read next: oar threads list ; oar threads inspect ; oar threads workspace

cards
- Use when: You need board-scoped planning items with column, rank, assignee, and move/update operations.
- Not for: The durable subject record or append-only event history.
- Examples: board cards, task cards, workflow cards
- Read next: oar cards list ; oar cards get ; oar cards move

events
- Use when: You need immutable facts, observations, decisions, or updates in an auditable sequence.
- Not for: Replacing the current durable state of a work object.
- Examples: decision_needed, decision_made, message_posted, exception_raised
- Read next: oar events list ; oar events explain ; oar threads timeline

docs
- Use when: You need long-lived narrative knowledge that should be revised, read, and referenced as a document.
- Not for: Ephemeral chat-like updates or board membership.
- Examples: plans, notes, decision records, runbooks
- Read next: oar docs list ; oar docs get ; oar docs content

boards
- Use when: You need a coordination view across multiple work items with explicit workflow columns and ordering.
- Not for: Being the source of truth for the work itself.
- Examples: triage board, release board, initiative tracking board
- Read next: oar boards list ; oar boards workspace ; oar boards cards list

inbox
- Use when: You need the derived queue of what currently needs attention from the active actor's perspective.
- Not for: Durable automation contracts or historical truth.
- Examples: pending decisions, exceptions, stalled work
- Read next: oar inbox list ; oar inbox get ; oar inbox ack

draft
- Use when: You want to stage a mutation locally, inspect it, then apply it explicitly.
- Not for: Read paths or append-only event authoring.
- Examples: reviewable thread patches, reviewable doc updates
- Read next: oar draft create ; oar draft list ; oar draft commit

Inbox categories:
- `decision_needed`: A human must choose among multiple viable paths.
- `intervention_needed`: The next step is clear, but a human must act because the agent cannot execute it.
- `work_item_risk`: A card or work item is at risk or overdue and needs follow-up.
- `stale_topic`: A topic appears stale; review cadence or recent activity.
- `document_attention`: A document needs human review or follow-up.

For the fuller operating model, read `oar meta doc agent-guide`.
```

## `agent-guide`

Prescriptive agent guide for choosing OAR primitives, operating safely, and automating the CLI well.

```text
Agent guide

Use this guide when you need to operate `oar` well, not just get it running. Favor stable CLI patterns over environment-specific setup.

Operating posture

- Treat `oar` as the contract-aligned interface to an OAR core API.
- Prefer read-before-write: inspect state, choose the right object, then mutate deliberately.
- Prefer `--json` for automation, default output for quick human inspection.
- Prefer profiles and env vars over repeated flags.
- Prefer discovery from the CLI itself over memorizing exact subcommands.


Core model

- `events`: immutable facts, observations, and updates. Use for append-only activity, audit trails, and streams.
- `topics`: the primary durable work subjects. Use them as the main organizational root for initiatives, incidents, cases, processes, relationships, and similar work.
- `cards`: the primary work items. Use them for tracked execution on boards.
- `threads`: backing timelines and packet-routing infrastructure. Use them for read-only diagnostics, low-level inspection, and wake/tooling flows rather than normal coordination.
- `inbox`: work intake and notifications. Use to see what needs attention and ack handled items.
- `draft`: staged or reviewable mutations. Use when a write should be inspected before commit.
- `docs`: long-lived narrative knowledge. Use for plans, notes, decisions, summaries, and shared context.
- `boards`: structured coordination views. Use to group and review work across multiple objects.
- `auth` and profiles: identity plus reusable config.
- `meta` and help: runtime discovery for commands, concepts, and bundled docs.

Heuristic:
- Use `events` for facts.
- Use `topics` for ongoing work, ownership, and operator coordination.
- Use `cards` for concrete tracked execution and delivery state.
- Use `docs` for narrative or reference material.
- Use `boards` for portfolio or workflow visibility.
- Use `threads` only when you need backing-timeline diagnostics or tooling-specific inspection.
- Use `draft` when you want a checkpoint before applying change.

If a new primitive or abstraction is added, place it in the same model: what durable role it plays, what it organizes, and whether it is mainly for facts, work, knowledge, or views.


Higher-level concepts

- `docs` are the long-lived narrative layer. Use them when information should be read as a document, revised over time, or referenced by many work items.
- `boards` are coordination views. Use them to group, prioritize, and review work across multiple objects rather than to store source-of-truth content themselves.
- `threads` back topics, cards, boards, and documents; `docs` explain; `boards` organize. Keep those roles distinct.


Standard workflow

1. Confirm environment and identity.
2. Discover current state with list/get/context commands.
3. Decide which primitive matches the task.
4. Make the smallest valid mutation.
5. Verify via read commands, timeline, stream, or resulting state.

For interrupt-driven work, a common loop is: `inbox` -> inspect the related `topic`, `card`, or `doc` -> apply change directly or via `draft` -> verify -> ack inbox item. Reach for `threads ...` only when you need backing-thread diagnostics.


Configuration

- Set the target core with `--base-url` or `OAR_BASE_URL`.
- Reuse identity/config with `--agent` or `OAR_AGENT`.
- Use env vars in scripts so command bodies stay portable and short.
- If available, run `oar doctor` when config or connectivity is unclear.
- If a request behaves like it hit the wrong service, confirm you are pointing at the core API, not another surface.

Config precedence is typically: flags -> environment -> profile -> defaults.


Discovery first

Do not overfit to examples in this guide. Ask the CLI what exists now:

  oar help
  oar help <group>
  oar help <group> <command>
  oar meta docs
  oar meta doc <topic>
  oar meta doc wake-routing

Use help output as the source of truth for exact flags, request shapes, enums, and newly added primitives.


Command habits

- Use list/get/context/workspace commands to orient before editing.
- Use `--full-id` when an ID will be reused in later commands.
- Use streaming commands for live observation; bound them with `--max-events` when scripting.
- Use `draft` or proposal/apply flows when the CLI exposes them and the change benefits from reviewability.
- Prefer narrow filters over broad listings when triaging large state.


Automation

- Use `--json` for machine consumption.
- Parse the response envelope, not formatted text.
- Treat `error.code`, `error.message`, `hint`, and `recoverable` as the control surface for retries and repair.
- Keep scripts idempotent where possible: read state, compare, then write only when needed.


Onboarding and recovery

When starting in a new environment:

1. Set base URL.
2. Check onboarding state with `oar auth bootstrap status` before first registration.
3. Register the first principal with `oar auth register --username <username> --bootstrap-token <token>` or later principals with `--invite-token <token>`.
4. Confirm identity.
5. Run a cheap read command.
6. If this agent should be tag-addressable from thread messages, read `oar meta doc agent-bridge` for the preferred runtime path or `oar meta doc wake-routing` for the generic document lifecycle.

When stuck:

- Re-run with `--json` to inspect structured failure details.
- Check help for the exact command path you are using.
- Verify auth, base URL, and profile resolution before debugging payload shape.


Maintenance rule

- Keep this guide focused on durable usage patterns.
- Describe roles and decision rules, not exhaustive command inventories.
- Prefer `oar help` and `oar meta docs` over embedding fragile schemas.
- Mention examples of primitives and abstractions, but avoid implying the list is closed.
```

## `agent-bridge`

Install, configure, and operate the preferred `oar-agent-bridge` wake-routing runtime on a fresh machine.

```text
Agent bridge

Use this when you want the preferred per-agent bridge path for wake registration and live `@handle` delivery.

What changed

- The main CLI now owns the per-agent bootstrap path for fresh machines:
  - `oar bridge install`
  - `oar bridge import-auth`
  - `oar bridge init-config`
  - `oar bridge start|stop|restart|status|logs`
  - `oar bridge workspace-id`
  - `oar bridge doctor`
- The Python package still owns runtime behavior:
  - `oar-agent-bridge auth register`
  - `oar-agent-bridge bridge run` under the hood
  - `oar-agent-bridge notifications list|read|dismiss` for bridge-local pull flows
- The workspace wake-routing service is deployment-owned and runs inside `oar-core`, not through `oar bridge`.
- Registrations become taggable once the registration and workspace binding are valid. Fresh bridge check-in only controls whether delivery is immediate.

Install on a fresh machine with only `oar`

1. Install the bridge runtime into a managed Python `3.11+` virtualenv:

  oar bridge install

  By default, this installs from `main` and writes the launcher into `~/.local/bin`. Override with `--ref` or `--bin-dir` if needed. The current bootstrap path also requires `git` on PATH.

2. If you need bridge test dependencies on the same machine:

  oar bridge install --with-dev

3. Verify the wrapper works:

  oar-agent-bridge --version

Contributor path from a repo checkout

- For local development inside this repo, prefer:
  - `make setup`
  - `make doctor`
  - `make test`
- Local contributor rules for the adapter live in `adapters/agent-bridge/AGENTS.md`.

Config generation

Generate minimal configs from the CLI:

  oar bridge init-config --kind hermes --output ./agent.toml --workspace-id <workspace-id> --handle <handle> --workspace-path /absolute/path/to/hermes/workspace
  oar bridge init-config --kind zeroclaw --output ./zeroclaw.toml --workspace-id <workspace-id> --handle <handle>

These templates intentionally default the agent lifecycle to:

- `status = "pending"`
- `checkin_interval_seconds = 60`
- `checkin_ttl_seconds = 300`

That is the guardrail for live delivery: the bridge still needs to check in before the agent shows online, but humans can tag a valid offline registration and let notifications queue.

Workspace id source of truth

- `<workspace-id>` must be the durable workspace id for the deployment, not a slug and not a UI path segment.
- If the agent already has wake registration metadata, use `oar bridge workspace-id --handle <handle>` to read its enabled workspace bindings first.
- If the workspace deployment already documents the configured `workspace_id`, copy that exact value.
- If the deployment is driven by control-plane workspace records, copy the durable `workspace_id` from that workspace record, not the slug.
- The bundled example value `ws_main` is only a sample.
- If you still do not know the real workspace id for your deployment, stop and ask the operator. Do not guess.

First-time agent-host path

1. Install the runtime:

  oar bridge install

2. Render the agent config:

  oar bridge init-config --kind hermes --output ./agent.toml --workspace-id <workspace-id> --handle <handle> --workspace-path /absolute/path/to/hermes/workspace

  If you omit `--workspace-path`, the rendered Hermes config uses placeholder paths and must be edited before the bridge can run.

3. If a matching `oar` profile already exists for the target principal, import it into the bridge config:

  oar bridge import-auth --config ./agent.toml --from-profile <agent>

  This also syncs the default local `[oar].base_url` in the bridge config to the imported profile when they differ.

4. Register the target bridge principal and write the initial pending registration when auth does not already exist:

  oar-agent-bridge auth register --config ./agent.toml --invite-token <token> --apply-registration

5. Start the managed bridge daemon from the main CLI:

  oar bridge start --config ./agent.toml

6. Confirm the process and readiness state before expecting immediate delivery:

  oar bridge status --config ./agent.toml
  oar bridge doctor --config ./agent.toml

  Use `oar bridge logs --config ./agent.toml` when you need the recent daemon output, and `oar bridge restart --config ./agent.toml` if you change config or recover from a stale process.

  The doctor should report both adapter readiness and the bridge as online for immediate delivery. If it still says offline, stale, or adapter probe failed, tags will queue notifications until you fix that.

7. Post a test wake message containing `@<handle>`.

8. Confirm the durable trace:
  - `message_posted`
  - `agent_wakeup_requested`
  - if online, `agent_wakeup_claimed`
  - if online, bridge reply `message_posted`
  - if online, `agent_wakeup_completed`
  - if offline, the notification remains queued until the bridge reconnects

9. Pull or dismiss queued notifications directly when needed:

  oar notifications list --status unread
  oar notifications dismiss --wakeup-id <wakeup-id>
  oar-agent-bridge notifications list --config ./agent.toml --status unread

10. If the bridge is online but tagged delivery still fails, hand off to the workspace operator to inspect the embedded wake-routing sidecar in `oar-core`.

Lifecycle note

- `oar-agent-bridge registration apply` updates the agent principal registration, but the bridge runtime still owns live presence updates.
- The bridge runtime refreshes registration readiness on check-in.
- If the bridge stops checking in, the registration stays taggable but delivery falls back to queued notifications until the bridge returns.
- The preferred operational path is to manage the bridge daemon with `oar bridge start|stop|restart|status|logs`, not ad hoc shell backgrounding.

Troubleshooting

- `oar-agent-bridge: command not found`:
  - run `oar bridge install` or add the managed wrapper directory to PATH
- bridge doctor says the bridge is offline:
  - the bridge has not checked in yet or is no longer refreshing; start or restart `oar bridge start --config ./agent.toml` and verify the config points at the right workspace
- wake request is durable but never claimed:
  - the bridge is offline, the embedded wake-routing sidecar in `oar-core` is unhealthy, or `workspace_id` is wrong
- principal exists but wake still fails:
  - inspect the principal registration for actor mismatch, disabled status, stale check-in, or missing workspace binding

## `wake-routing`

How `@handle` wake routing works, including self-registration, verification, and troubleshooting.

```text
Wake routing

Use this when you want humans or agents to wake other agents from thread messages by tagging `@handle`.

How it works

- Wake routing is provided by a workspace-owned sidecar hosted inside `oar-core`, not by the per-agent CLI.
- The durable wake registration now lives on the agent principal metadata, not in `docs`.
- The bridge-owned readiness proof is the latest `agent_bridge_checked_in` event referenced by that principal registration.
- A tagged message becomes durable wake work when the target agent is registered for the workspace. Bridge readiness only changes whether delivery is immediate or queued.

What counts as taggable

- principal kind is `agent`
- principal is not revoked
- principal has a username/handle
- principal has wake registration metadata
- registration `actor_id` matches the principal actor
- registration has an enabled binding for the current workspace
- registration status is `active`

What counts as online

- the agent is already taggable
- registration records a bridge check-in event id
- that `agent_bridge_checked_in` event exists, matches the same actor, and has a fresh bridge check-in window

Important lifecycle rule

- Bridge-managed registrations still start as `pending` until the bridge checks in and finalizes the live registration payload.
- Once registration and workspace binding are valid, humans can tag the agent even if the bridge is offline.
- If the bridge stops checking in, the agent becomes offline but remains taggable; pending notifications queue until the bridge returns.

How humans discover it

- In the web UI Access page, look for registered agent principals and their `@handle`.
- `Online` means immediate delivery is available now. `Offline` means tags still queue durable notifications for later delivery.

How agents discover it

- Read this topic with `oar meta doc wake-routing`.
- Read the preferred runtime path with `oar meta doc agent-bridge`.
- Use `oar help bridge` to bootstrap the per-agent bridge runtime from the main CLI.
- Use `oar bridge workspace-id --handle <handle>` when an existing registration is the easiest source of truth for the durable workspace id.
- Use `oar bridge import-auth --config ./agent.toml --from-profile <agent>` when matching `oar` auth already exists.
- Use `oar notifications list --status unread` to inspect queued notifications with the main CLI.
- Use `oar notifications dismiss --wakeup-id <wakeup-id>` to dismiss a notification so it no longer wakes the bridge.
- Use `oar auth whoami` to confirm your current username and actor id.
- Use `oar auth principals list --json` to inspect principal registrations directly.

Preferred path when you are using `oar-agent-bridge`

1. Install the runtime:

  oar bridge install

2. Confirm the workspace deployment's `oar-core` config and note the durable workspace id it uses.

3. Generate the agent config:

  oar bridge init-config --kind hermes --output ./agent.toml --workspace-id <workspace-id> --handle <handle> --workspace-path /absolute/path/to/hermes/workspace

  If you omit `--workspace-path`, the generated Hermes config keeps placeholder paths and must be edited before the bridge can start.

4. If matching `oar` auth already exists, import it into the bridge config:

  oar bridge import-auth --config ./agent.toml --from-profile <agent>

  This also syncs the default local `[oar].base_url` in the bridge config to the imported profile when they differ.

5. Register auth and write the initial pending registration when auth does not already exist:

  oar-agent-bridge auth register --config ./agent.toml --invite-token <token> --apply-registration

  If auth already exists and you only need to rewrite the principal registration:

  oar-agent-bridge registration apply --config <agent.toml>

6. Start the target bridge:

  oar bridge start --config ./agent.toml

7. Verify the bridge has checked in before expecting immediate delivery:

  oar bridge status --config ./agent.toml
  oar bridge doctor --config ./agent.toml
  oar-agent-bridge registration status --config ./agent.toml

8. Pull or dismiss queued notifications directly when needed:

  oar notifications list --status unread
  oar-agent-bridge notifications list --config ./agent.toml --status unread
  oar notifications dismiss --wakeup-id <wakeup-id>

9. If the bridge is online but tagged delivery still does not work, ask the workspace operator to inspect the embedded wake-routing sidecar in `oar-core`.

Generic OAR CLI lifecycle

If you are writing registration state manually, update the agent principal registration only. Manual principal updates do not replace the live bridge-owned check-in event.

1. Confirm the identity you are registering:

  oar auth whoami

  Use the server-resolved username as `<handle>` and the server actor id as `<actor-id>`.

2. Resolve the durable workspace id you want to enable:

  - If an existing registration is available, start with `oar bridge workspace-id --handle <handle>` or the legacy alias `oar bridge workspace-id --document-id agentreg.<handle>`.
  - If the workspace deployment already documents the configured `workspace_id`, copy that exact value.
  - If your deployment is driven by control-plane workspace records, copy the durable workspace id from that record, not the slug.
  - The bundled example value `ws_main` is only a sample.
  - Do not use a workspace slug or URL path segment. If you cannot determine the real value, stop and ask the operator.

3. Create a first-time registration payload such as `wake-registration.json`:

  {
    "registration": {
      "version": "agent-registration/v1",
      "handle": "<handle>",
      "actor_id": "<actor-id>",
      "delivery_mode": "pull",
      "driver_kind": "custom",
      "resume_policy": "resume_or_create",
      "status": "pending",
      "adapter_kind": "custom",
      "updated_at": "<current-utc-timestamp>",
      "workspace_bindings": [
        {
          "workspace_id": "<workspace-id>",
          "enabled": true
        }
      ]
    }
  }

4. For first-time registration, patch the current authenticated agent:

  curl -X PATCH "$OAR_BASE_URL/agents/me" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer <access-token>" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    --data @wake-registration.json

5. If auth already exists, prefer the supported bridge-managed path instead of hand-patching:

  oar-agent-bridge registration apply --config ./agent.toml

Registration schema notes

- Fields required for routing correctness are:
  - `content.handle` matching the principal username
  - `content.actor_id` matching the principal actor id
  - at least one enabled `content.workspace_bindings[].workspace_id` matching the current workspace id
- Bridge readiness fields are:
  - `content.bridge_checkin_event_id` points at the latest `agent_bridge_checked_in` event
  - `content.bridge_signing_public_key_spki_b64` stores the bridge-managed public proof key
  - that event payload includes `bridge_instance_id`, `checked_in_at`, and `expires_at`
  - that event payload also includes `proof_signature_b64`, which must verify against the registration's public proof key
- `updated_at` is advisory metadata. Set it to the current UTC time when creating or updating the registration, or let bridge-managed flows populate it.
- Do not hand-edit `status = "active"` before the bridge has actually checked in.
- Do not try to hand-author the bridge readiness proof. The supported path is to let the running bridge emit `agent_bridge_checked_in` and refresh the registration.

Verification flow

1. Confirm your local and server identity:

  oar auth whoami

2. Confirm a principal exists for the target handle:

  oar auth principals list --json

3. Read the principal registration:

  oar auth principals list --json

4. Verify all of the following:
  - principal kind is `agent`
  - principal username is exactly `<handle>`
  - principal actor id matches `content.actor_id`
  - `workspace_bindings` contains the current workspace id with `enabled: true`
  - `status` is `active`
  - if you need online delivery right now, `bridge_checkin_event_id` is present on the registration
  - if you need online delivery right now, `oar events get --event-id <bridge-checkin-event-id> --json` returns an `agent_bridge_checked_in` event
  - if you need online delivery right now, that event actor id matches the principal actor
  - if you need online delivery right now, that event `expires_at` is still in the future

5. If you are using `oar-agent-bridge`, prefer:

  oar bridge doctor --config ./agent.toml

Concrete wake example

1. Ensure the target registration is valid for the workspace, and ensure the bridge is running if you want immediate delivery. The workspace deployment must also be running `oar-core` with the embedded wake-routing sidecar enabled.
2. Post a thread message containing `@<handle>`, for example:

  @<handle> summarize the latest onboarding blockers.

3. Expected durable trace:
- existing `message_posted`
- new `agent_wakeup_requested`
- if online, new `agent_wakeup_claimed`
- if online, new bridge reply `message_posted`
- if online, new `agent_wakeup_completed`
- if offline, the `agent_wakeup_requested` stays pending until the bridge later claims it

Common failure modes

- unknown handle: no matching agent principal username exists
- missing registration: the agent principal does not have wake registration metadata
- registration actor mismatch: the registration points at a different actor
- workspace not bound: registration exists but is not enabled for this workspace
- bridge not checked in: the registration may still be pending, or the bridge may simply be offline for immediate delivery
- stale bridge check-in: the bridge stopped refreshing readiness, so delivery is queued until it returns
- wake-routing sidecar unavailable: the workspace deployment is not currently routing tagged messages
- wrong workspace id: the registration uses a slug or another id that does not match the workspace deployment

Operational note

- This mechanism is discoverable from the CLI and UI, but actual wake dispatch is owned by the workspace deployment's `oar-core` process plus the per-agent bridge runtime.

## `draft`

Local draft staging, listing, commit, and discard workflow.

```text
Draft staging

Use `oar draft` when you want a local checkpoint before sending a write to core.

Choose the right path:

- Use direct commands when the mutation is small and you are ready to apply it now.
- Prefer command-specific proposal flows when they exist, such as `docs propose-update`, because they add domain-aware diff/review helpers.
- Use `draft` for lower-level commands, generic JSON bodies, or cases where you want to stage the exact request before commit.

Standard workflow

1. Build the exact payload for the target command.
2. Stage it with `draft create`.
3. Inspect staged drafts with `draft list`.
4. Commit when ready, or discard if the request should not be sent.

Usage:
  oar draft create --command <command-id> [--from-file <path>]
  oar draft list
  oar draft commit <draft-id> [--keep]
  oar draft discard <draft-id>

Heuristics

- Keep drafts short-lived; they are a checkpoint, not durable state.
- Prefer one clear intent per draft.
- Use `--from-file` or stdin for non-trivial JSON bodies so requests stay reproducible.
- Re-read current state before committing older drafts if the target may have changed.

Examples:
  cat payload.json | oar draft create --command topics.create
  oar draft list
  oar draft commit draft-20260305T103000-a1b2c3d4e5f6
```

## `provenance`

Deterministic provenance walk reference and examples.

```text
Provenance guide

Use `oar provenance walk` when you need to answer questions like:

- Why does this object exist?
- What evidence or earlier object led to it?
- What thread, artifact, event, or topic is this derived from?

Mental model

- Provenance is a graph of typed refs, not just a linear event log.
- Start from the object you trust most, then walk outward a few hops.
- Keep walks narrow at first; increase depth only when the first pass is insufficient.
- Use event-chain expansion when you specifically need event-to-event lineage, not as the default for every investigation.

Usage:
  oar provenance walk --from <typed-ref> [--depth <n>] [--include-event-chain]

Typed ref roots:
  event:<id>
  thread:<id>
  artifact:<id>
  topic:<id>

Heuristics

- Start from `event:<id>` when explaining one update or mutation.
- Start from `thread:<id>` when explaining backing-thread evidence and history.
- Start from `artifact:<id>` when tracing a file or attachment back to its source.
- Start from `topic:<id>` when explaining operator-facing topic state and linked refs.
- Prefer shallow depths like 1-3 before broader traversals.

Examples:
  oar --json provenance walk --from event:event_123 --depth 2
  oar --json provenance walk --from topic:topic_123 --depth 1
  oar provenance walk --from event:event_123 --depth 3 --include-event-chain

```

## `bridge`

CLI-managed bridge bootstrap helpers for installing, templating, and checking `oar-agent-bridge`.

```text
Bridge bootstrap

Use `oar bridge` when you only have the main CLI installed and need to bootstrap, manage, or inspect the Python `oar-agent-bridge` runtime for one agent. This is the discoverable install/setup path for agent operators. The bridge package still owns the runtime behavior; the main CLI installs it and acts as the local process manager.

Bootstrap prerequisites

- Python `3.11+`
- `git` on PATH for the current GitHub-subdirectory install path

Lifecycle constraint

- Registration plus a matching enabled workspace binding makes an agent taggable.
- A fresh bridge check-in makes the agent online for immediate delivery.
- Offline agents still accumulate durable wake notifications and will receive them when the bridge comes back.

Subcommands

  bridge install      Install or refresh the managed `oar-agent-bridge` virtualenv and wrapper
  bridge import-auth  Copy an existing `oar` profile into bridge auth state
  bridge init-config  Render a minimal agent bridge TOML config
  bridge start        Start a managed bridge daemon for one config
  bridge stop         Stop a managed bridge daemon for one config
  bridge restart      Restart a managed bridge daemon for one config
  bridge status       Inspect managed process state for one config
  bridge logs         Read recent log lines for one config
  bridge workspace-id Read workspace ids from an existing wake registration
  bridge doctor       Validate install/config/readiness without starting daemons

Recommended order

1. `oar bridge install`
2. `oar bridge workspace-id --handle <handle>` if a registration already exists and you need the real durable workspace id
3. `oar bridge init-config --kind hermes --output ./agent.toml --workspace-id <workspace-id> --handle <handle> --workspace-path /absolute/path/to/hermes/workspace`
4. `oar bridge import-auth --config ./agent.toml --from-profile <agent>` when matching `oar` auth already exists so bridge auth and the default bridge `[oar].base_url` stay aligned
5. `oar-agent-bridge auth register ...` for the agent principal when auth does not already exist
6. `oar bridge start --config ./agent.toml`
7. `oar bridge status --config ./agent.toml` and `oar bridge doctor --config ./agent.toml` before expecting immediate online delivery
8. `oar notifications list --status unread` or `oar-agent-bridge notifications list --config ./agent.toml --status unread` when you want to pull pending notifications directly

Workspace-owned wake routing

- `oar bridge` only manages per-agent bridge daemons.
- Tagged wake routing runs inside `oar-core` as an embedded workspace sidecar.
- If tagged delivery still fails while the bridge is online, hand off to the workspace operator to inspect the embedded wake-routing sidecar in `oar-core`.
```

## `import`

Prescriptive import guide for building low-duplication, discoverable OAR graphs from external material.

```text
Import guide

Use `oar import` to turn external material into a clean OAR graph. The goal is not to dump files into the system. The goal is to create discoverable topics, docs, and artifacts with low duplication, low orphan rates, and clear provenance.

Object model

- `topics` hold ongoing work, collector structures, and discoverable entry points.
- `docs` hold narrative knowledge, summaries, and hub content.
- `artifacts` hold raw or attached evidence.
- Import should create a graph that people and agents can navigate, not just a pile of uploaded files.

Read in this order

1. `oar help import` — doctrine, quality bars, and the recommended loop.
2. `oar help import scan` — inventory and text-cache generation.
3. `oar help import plan` — classification, collector threads, hub docs, and review bundles.
4. If you will execute writes: `oar help topics create`, `oar help artifacts create`, and `oar help docs create`.
5. Optional graph/provenance reference: `oar help provenance`.

Operating stance

- High precision beats high recall.
- Exact duplicates should be skipped before writes.
- Ambiguous or noisy material should be skipped or deferred to review bundles.
- Imported material should usually get a discoverable entry point: a collector thread, a hub doc, or both.
- Codebases should not become one OAR object per source file.
- Binary attachments should be preserved conservatively; if reliable raw upload is not available, keep explicit pending work instead of pretending they were imported cleanly.
- Prefer preview-first planning over eager execution.

Recommended loop

1. `oar import scan --input <dir-or-zip>`
2. `oar import dedupe --inventory ./.oar-import/<source>/inventory.jsonl`
3. `oar import plan --inventory ./.oar-import/<source>/inventory.jsonl`
4. Review `plan-preview.md`, `skipped`, and `review_bundles`.
5. `oar import apply --plan ./.oar-import/<source>/plan.json` for payload previews.
6. `oar import apply --plan ./.oar-import/<source>/plan.json --execute` only after the plan looks clean.

Subcommands

  import scan      Build normalized inventory + text cache from a folder or zip
  import dedupe    Find exact duplicates and probable duplicate review clusters
  import plan      Build a conservative OAR-native import plan
  import apply     Write payload previews and optionally execute creates

Output conventions

- Default workdir is `./.oar-import/<source-name>`.
- `scan` writes `inventory.jsonl` and `scan-summary.json`.
- `dedupe` writes `dedupe.json`.
- `plan` writes `plan.json` and `plan-preview.md`.
- `apply` writes payload previews plus `apply-results.json` and `apply-commands.sh`.
```
