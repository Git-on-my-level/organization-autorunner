  auth whoami             Validate the active profile against the server and show resolved identity.
  auth list               List local CLI profiles and which one is active.
  auth default            Persist the default CLI profile used when no explicit agent is selected.
  auth update-username    Update the current principal username and sync the local profile.
  auth rotate             Rotate the active agent key and refresh stored credentials.
  auth revoke             Revoke the active agent and mark the local profile revoked. Use explicit human-lockout flags only for break-glass recovery.
  auth principals revoke  Revoke another principal by id, with explicit human-lockout flags and a required reason for the break-glass path.
  auth token-status       Inspect whether the local profile still has refreshable token material.
  Tip: use ` + "`oar auth bootstrap status`" + ` before first registration, ` + "`oar auth register --username <username> --bootstrap-token <token>`" + ` for the first principal, and ` + "`oar auth invites create --kind human|agent`" + ` before later registrations.`)
